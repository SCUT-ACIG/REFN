## 📖 Overview

REFN (Recognizing Emotions with Functional Near-infrared spectroscopy) is a comprehensive multimodal affective dataset designed for emotion analysis research using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). This dataset addresses the critical shortage of publicly available fNIRS emotion datasets and provides a valuable resource for advancing emotion recognition research.

**Publication**: *CSIG Conference on Emotional Intelligence 2024*  
**Authors**: Dengjun Sun, Chunmei Qing*, Zhili Lai, Wanxiang Luo, Xiangmin Xu  
**Affiliation**: South China University of Technology

## 🎯 Key Features

- **28 participants** (14 males, 14 females, ages 19-27)
- **5 discrete emotions**: Pride, Happy, Neutral, Fear, Sad
- **3 recording sessions** per participant (one week apart)
- **Multimodal data**:
  - 48-channel fNIRS signals (11 Hz sampling rate)
  - Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) data
  - Photoplethysmographic (PPG) data
  - Facial expression videos (60 fps)

## 📊 Dataset Composition

### Experimental Design

- **Stimuli**: Carefully selected movie clips (2-4 minutes each)
- **Validation**: Pre-screened by 30 participants with arousal scores ≥5/10
- **Protocol**: 15 trials per session (3 trials per emotion)
- **Environment**: Soundproof room with controlled lighting

### Data Collection

- **fNIRS System**: 48-channel NirScan (HuiChuang, China)
  - Wavelengths: 730 nm and 850 nm
  - Coverage: Frontal and temporal cortical regions
  - 10/20 international system positioning

- **Physiological Sensors**: Shimmer3 wearable device
  - GSR and PPG data collection

- **Video Recording**: Logitech C1000e camera
  - Frontal facial expressions at 60 fps

## 🔬 Research Highlights

### Hemodynamic Response Analysis

Our study reveals distinct oxyhemoglobin (HbO) activation patterns across different emotional states:

- **Pride**: Strong HbO activation, peaking around 10 seconds
- **Happy**: High initial activation with sustained increase
- **Neutral**: Stable, moderate HbO levels
- **Fear**: Lower activation compared to neutral
- **Sad**: Negative HbO activation, contrasting with positive emotions

### Classification Performance

We established baseline performance using both machine learning and deep learning models:

#### Subject-Specific Classification
- **5-class**: Up to 32.4% accuracy (CNN)
- **2-class (Positive/Negative)**: Up to 64.2% accuracy (Transformer)

#### Cross-Participant Classification
- **5-class**: Up to 28.1% accuracy (LSTM)
- **2-class (Positive/Negative)**: Up to 57.8% accuracy (Transformer)

#### Pairwise Binary Classification (Best Results)
- **Subject-specific**: Up to 71.5% accuracy (Fear vs. Pride)
- **Cross-participant**: Up to 62.9% accuracy (Fear vs. Pride)
